## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 
20/20. The `npm test` did skip a few tests so I'm not sure if thats something I did or part of the tests.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I really liked this assignment because I like working with js and the instrctions were really clear and helpful. The chating script we wrote was really interesting and I like leanring more about how it works. 
### How long it took me to finish this?
This assignment surprisingly only took a couple of hours to do (if that). 
## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
It's a bootstrap class that displays a certain size and format for the web page.
