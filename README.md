## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I really liked this assignment because I like working with js and the instrctions were really clear and helpful. The chating script we wrote was really interesting and I like leanring more about how it works.

This part of the assignment was a little more tricky, I was dounting myself earlier in the week, but I'm happy with no ajustments to my code.
